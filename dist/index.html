i tried to build this site as a minimalistic image host that auto deletes all files
after 7 days so that i don't have to stumble on cringy screenshots from years ago.

terms of service:
1. you agree that this is beautiful web design.
2. do not upload anything that is either:
  2.1 illegal in luxembourg.
  2.2 will annoy my hosting provider buyvm.net

this site and its storage are hosted by <a href="https://buyvm.net"/>https://buyvm.net</a> in a datacenter located in luxembourg.
